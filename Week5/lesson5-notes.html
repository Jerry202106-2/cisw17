        <h2>Lesson 9: Working Margins, Padding, Alignment, and Floating</h2>
            <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
            <p>In this lesson, I learned some of the most fundamental style properties in CSS-based design: margin, padding and float. I learned that the margin controls the space around the outside of elements.
                And the padding works with space within the elments.
            </p>
            <p>In this lesson, I also learned about the float property. There are left, right in float property. The float property allows for specific placement of elements and additional content arount those elements.</p>

        <h2>Lesson 10: Understanding the CSS Box Model and Positioning</h2>
        <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
        <p>In this lesson, we began with an important discussion about the CSS box model. Like how to calculate the width and height of elements when considering margins, padding, and borders. I also learned 
            change the default box model by using the box-sizing property. I also learned about the positioning using z-index.
        </p>
        <p>I learned about the type of positioning: relative - The element is positioned relative to its current position in the document flow; absolute - The element is positioned based on its container element.
             fixed - The element is positioned relative to the brow window; static - The element is placed as it appears in the normal flow. This is the default.

    <h2>Lesson 11: Using CSS to Do More with Lists, Text, and Navigation</h2>
    <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
    <p>In this lesson, I learned about how style and lists can affect the overal site design. Like how lists and lis elements are affected by padding and margin styles. I also learned about the default
         padding associated with lists and how to control that padding. And I also learned how to modify padding and margin values and how to place the list item indicator either inside the list item or outside it.
          I also learned about the element of map.
    </p>
    <p>I also learned how to use unorderdd lists to product horizontal or vertical navigation within the website. By using CSS instead of graphics, it will be more flexibility in both the display and 
         maintenance of the website. I also learned turn plain underlined text links into areas with borders and background colors and other text styles. It is very helpful for buliding a website.
