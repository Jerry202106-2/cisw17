Lesson 3: Understanding Cascading Style Sheets
=====================================================
Summary:
	I learned a lot in this lesson. I learned that how to create a basic style sheet and how the CSS works in a web page. I learned that a style sheet can control the appearance of many HTML pages at once. I also learned that adding a style attribute to almost any HTML tag, the style of this HTML tag can be controled. CSS is very powerful to make the HTML page to be better.
	I aslo learned that there are three main approaches to including style sheets in your web stie: 
1. adding a separate style sheet file with the extension .css, and this file need to be linked in the <head> of the HTML.
2. We can add a style rules in the <head> within <style> tag.
3. We can add rules directly in HTML tag via style attribute.
All of those three methods are the main methods to includeing style sheets in a HTML.
